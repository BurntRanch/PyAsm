# PyBash

PyBash is a general-purpose dynamic-typed language based on Python and Bash, It ends in .pyb format.

It is designed to help shell scripters be more experienced with python and other languages.

The engine uses match-case code to process each line.

TO-DO list:
1. You literally can't use commas in arguments
2. Classes? maybe later..

Change-Log:
1. PyBash functions that take more than one argument now behave like they are supposed to (BugFix)
2. PyBash will pass unknown arguments to the python interpreter.
